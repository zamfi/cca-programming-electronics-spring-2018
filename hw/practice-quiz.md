### Practice Quiz

On Wednesday, April 4, we'll have an in-class paper exam. This upcoming Wednesday, March 28, we'll review this practice quiz. Please try to complete it before then -- the practice quiz is one of the most useful things you can do for your grade in this class.

Here's [the practice quiz itself](practice-quiz.pdf).

Instructions:

- The in-class examination will be open-book, open-notes, but closed-computer. (No digital devices will be allowed.) The format will be very similar to this practice quiz.

- To complete the practice quiz, take as long as you need (though be aware that we'll give you 2 hours in class), see what you can do without your computer, and use whatever notes you plan to bring. This is also a good opportunity for you to flesh out your notes if you're missing anything.

- Scan (or photograph with your cell phone) your completed practice quiz and [email it to me](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) (don't put this in github) by Tuesday night, 11:59pm on March 27.
