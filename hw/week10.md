### Homework 10 (due Wednesday, April 4, 2017)

Prepare for next week's in-class quiz, on Wednesday, April 4. As a reminder, here are the rules and expectations for the quiz:

- Open-notes -- bring whatever notes you wish, including the practice quiz! Printed-out notes are fine.
- No electronic devices allowed -- no mobile phones, no laptops, no tables, no kindles, no Arduinos -- in short, nothing electronic and nothing that can run code (except your brain!)

But first, write a proposal for your final project and [send it to me](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) by Wednesday, April 4.

#### Final Project

Prepare a proposal for your final project. If you're not sure what you want to do, [email me](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) a few thoughts and I'm happy to send you my opinions on what would make a good project.

Some examples of past final projects:

- Laser guitar: this piece involved a solid wood guitar using lasers and light sensors instead of strings. "Playing" the guitar involved breaking the laser beams with your fingers or a pick, which triggered musical notes.
- Capacitive touch flute: this flute used capacitive touch to detect the player touching screws mounted into a wooden board, playing tones through a speaker attached to an Arduino.
- DDR Laser Dance Pad: a repurposed dance pad required that you keep dancing to keep the music playing and the laser light show going on.
- Lit Planters: a set of 3D-printed plants that respond to people walking around and interacting.
- Piano player: molded plastic fingers, connected to servo motors with strings, that pull the fingers down to play an electric keyboard. Reads the MIDI format and plays music!
- SensorBot: a wall-detecting robot that follows the walls in a room, measuring distance and light level as it goes.
- Wall Drawbot: a wall-mounted pen controlled by an Arduino that can draw an arbitrary drawing, perhaps from an SVG file.

**Assignment**: Create a new github repository for your final project, and modify the README.md file to include your project proposal. To learn about formatting text in markdown `.md` files, read [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) and look at the [project proposal template](project-template.md).

I've also created a [sample project proposal](sample-proposal.md) for your perusal.

Your proposal should be thoughtful and complete, and should take into consideration any feedback you received from me or your classmates. You can always modify what you're doing later on, but your proposal should describe a complete project.

The final project is your opportunity to put to work what you've learned so far in class, and to build the skills you're most interested in taking with you from this class.
